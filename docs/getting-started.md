## What is CTP Tech about?

This is a simple documentation page designed for hosting guides on the summer session programs at [CTP Ethiopia.](https://ctpethiopia.org/ "CTP")

We will be updating files and adding pages as we incorporate more software and add customizations.

As sessions start, we will also be adding guides on Authentication, assignment submissions methods, and other necessary activities for students and instructors.

### **System Status**

CTP is transparent on any system updates, upgrades, or new software installations.

We give out details on how the updates will affect personal accounts, and what you should do about these updates.

System Status is available at [status.my.ctpethiopia.org](https://status.my.ctpethiopia.org "Status")

## **Updates and Support**

Updates will be given on CTP Ethiopiaâ€™s [Tech Page.](https://tech.ctpethiopia.org/ "Updates")

For technical support, submit a ticket at our [Support Page](https://help.ctpethiopia.org/ "Support") or email us at [info@ctpethiopia.org](mailto:info%40ctpethiopia.org)
