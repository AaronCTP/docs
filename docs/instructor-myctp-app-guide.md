For instructors, we are setting up a separate Course as a guide to managing courses.

If you are an **instructor**, take a look at the following [course](https://ctpacademy.org/app/v1/course/view.php?id=7) to learn more about managing classes and students in your class.

Access to the [course](https://ctpacademy.org/app/v1/course/view.php?id=7) requires [authentication](/iam) and special access. If you donâ€™t have an account yet or have no access to the course, you can request help by creating a [support ticket](https://help.ctpethiopia.org/portal/en/newticket) with a **high** priority. If you also happen to be a board member, please check the [Trello](https://trello.com/ctp147/) page for weekly updates and tasks to be completed.
